Hardware part
============
* After all the components are there, connect them according to following circuit diagram : 
  <img alt="Circuit Diagram" width="600" src="https://github.com/PuL5TaR/Ascii-art-generator-py/assets/77431114/b9a8661c-bfeb-4792-a2fd-bc80d71cb221"/>
* Using a breadboard in connection will be helpful.

<br>

Software part
============
* Download & install the [ Arduino ide ](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to upload code to esp8266.
* Download & install the esp8266 board in the arduino ide by following [ this ](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/how-to-install-esp8266-board-arduino-ide/).
* Take the code from "ultrasonic_glass.ino" and paste it in a new sketch in the arduino ide.
* Connect the Nodemcu to your system, and in arduino ide select it's port and board (in tool option).
* Then click upload code. After the code uploaded the nodemcu will quicky start it's operation.

How to use
============
After the Hardware part & Software part is complete : 

It will start it operation 

* It can be powered by the usb cable and a charger
* But in order to power it on battery a proper power source is required
     * In this project 2 Li-ion 18650 rechargable batteries are used
